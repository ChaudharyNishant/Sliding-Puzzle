# Sliding-Puzzle
The puzzle game in which you have to slide the boxes so that the numbers on the boxes are arranged.

There are 8 numbered boxes from 1 to 8 kept in some order in a 3x3 matrix with 1 blank space. You have to move one box in the blank space at a time so that the numbered boxes are arranged in ascending order and the blank space is at the end. Do this in minimum number of steps. The number of steps to reach the final state increases with the level.

You can restart the level if you think you have made it more difficult. You can also restart or quit the game at any time.
